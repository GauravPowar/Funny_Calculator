# **Funny Calculator**

Welcome to the Funny Calculator! This is a simple and entertaining calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations and adds a humorous touch by displaying funny messages **instead of the result** for simple calculations.

## **Co-Developed By**
This project is co-developed by:
- [@GauravPowar](https://github.com/GauravPowar)
- [@Vasumitra1](https://github.com/Vasumitra1)

You can find the repository on GitHub: [Funny Calculator Repository](https://github.com/GauravPowar/Funny_Calculator)

## **Features**
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- **Funny Messages Instead of Results**: If the answer is between `0` and `100`, a random funny message will be displayed **instead of the actual result**.
- **Clear Input**: Easily reset the input with the AC button.
- **Keyboard Support**: Use the keyboard to input values and perform calculations.

## **Getting Started**

To use the Funny Calculator:

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start calculating and see the funny messages replace your answers for easy calculations!

## **File Structure**
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the calculator.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the calculator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles calculations, keypress events, and funny messages.

## **How It Works**

The calculator includes:
1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (`%`).
2. **Funny Responses Instead of Results**: 
   - If the calculated answer is **between 0 and 100**, a random funny message will be displayed **instead of the actual result**.
   - For **larger or more complex calculations**, the real result is displayed normally.
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Type numbers and operators directly.
   - Press "Enter" to calculate.
   - Press "Backspace" to delete the last character.
4. **Clear**: Press "AC" to reset the calculator.

## **Example Calculations**
- **Simple Calculation**: `2 + 2`
    - Instead of `4`, it shows: `"Did you really need a calculator for this? ðŸ˜†"`
- **Complex Calculation**: `152 Ã— 78`
    - Result: `11856` (Displays the actual result)
- **Invalid Input**: If the input is invalid, the calculator will display: `"Invalid input!"`

## **Customization**
Want to add your own funny messages? Edit the `funnyMessages` array in `script.js`. You can also modify the calculatorâ€™s styling in `style.css`.
